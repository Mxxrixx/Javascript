        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Marya Almasri and I am a shadow teacher. My main responsibility is to provide support and assistance to students with special needs in a mainstream classroom setting. I work closely with the classroom teacher to develop individualized education plans (IEPs) that address the specific needs of each student. I also provide one-on-one support during classroom activities and help with socialization and communication skills..</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading and writing. I have set myself a goal this year to finish at least twelve books. It's not a lot, but between my work and my studies there isn't a lot of time, which is why I gave myself this challenge.</p>
        <p>As for my personal life, I come from a big family with four sisters. Growing up with so many siblings was chaotic at times, but also very rewarding. We learned to share and cooperate, and we always had each other's backs. I am very grateful for my family and the values they instilled in me.</p>
